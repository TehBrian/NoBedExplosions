# World configuration for NoBedExplosions.
#
# Each world has its own configuration section, identified by the world's name.
# Only worlds that you want to modify need to be added here.
#
# Configuration for a world contains bed config and anchor config.
# Both sections have two settings: the mode, and optionally
# a message to be sent to the player.
#
# Message formatting syntax is MiniMessage, which you can read up on here:
# https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage.html
#
# Modes available for beds:
#   allow   - lets the player sleep in the bed
#   deny    - prevents the player from entering the bed
#   default - default functionality
#   explode - explodes the bed if the player tries to enter it
#
# Modes available for anchors:
#   deny    - prevents the player from using the anchor if it will explode
#   default - default functionality
